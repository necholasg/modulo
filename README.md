Tecnologies: MongoDB,Express.js,React, Redux, Node.js, Webpack, Babel, Passport, Socket.io, Sass, paper.js, Bootstrap and JWT.

*Quick and simple React application built to collaborate on projects with former classmates, Socket.io was used for the chat feature and the 'Virtual' whiteboard*

- - - -

###Features:###
- Passport allows Users to successfully login and register.
- Redux-Form used for form validation and management.
- Redux used to manage state for messages.
- Socket.io used for the Chat feature and creating the socket generated drawing area.
- Webpack used for development with the dev-server and used for building the production "minified" application.
- Mongo used to store user data.
- Paper.js used to manipulate the HTML5 canvas.

###Thing I would like to add in the future:###
- Dashboard displaying multiple rooms that users can choose to enter.
- Profile page
- Friends list
- Adding all of the user produced data for drawing into state while logged in, so drawings persist through refresh like the messages.
